    <p>Apple Watch is a line of smartwatches produced by Apple Inc. It incorporates fitness tracking, health-oriented capabilities, and wireless telecommunication, and integrates with iOS and other Apple products and services.

        The Apple Watch was released in April 2015[18][19] and quickly became the best-selling wearable device: 4.2 million were sold in the second quarter of fiscal 2015,[20][21] and more than 100 million people were estimated to use an Apple Watch as of December 2020.[22] Apple has introduced new generations of the Apple Watch with improved internal components each September[23][24][25][26]—each labeled by Apple a 'Series', with certain exceptions.[a]
        
        Each Series has been initially sold in multiple variants defined by the watch casing's material, color, and size (except for the budget watches Series 1 and SE, available only in aluminum[27][29]), and beginning with Series 3, by the option in the aluminum variants for LTE cellular connectivity, which comes standard with the other materials.[30] The band included with the watch can be selected from multiple options from Apple, and watch variants in aluminum co-branded with Nike and in stainless steel co-branded with Hermès are also offered, which include exclusive bands and digital watch faces carrying those companies' brandings.[30]</p>
